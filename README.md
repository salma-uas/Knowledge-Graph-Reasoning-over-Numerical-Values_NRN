# R&D Project: Numerical Reasoning Network (NRN) Model Evaluation for Knowledge Graph Reasoning on Numerical Data
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the Numerical Reasoning Network (NRN) model, aimed at evaluating its effectiveness in handling complex, numerically driven queries within knowledge graphs. The project investigates NRN's preprocessing and embedding techniques for numerical data, focusing on two primary encoding methods: Gaussian Mixture Models and Sinusoidal encodings.

## Key components of this R&D project include:

Numerical Data Preprocessing and Encoding: An in-depth investigation of numerical encoding strategies and methods, including Gaussian Mixture Models and Sinusoidal encodings.
Model Performance Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using MRR and Hit@K metrics for practical applicability in the sustainability domain.
Practical Applicability: Insights into the NRN modelâ€™s real-world applicability, along with suggestions for future improvements, demonstrating its potential to enhance numerical reasoning capabilities in knowledge graphs.
